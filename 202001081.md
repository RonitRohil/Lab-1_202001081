** Q1: Identify FRs and NFRs:
Ans: **

### Functional Requirements:
    1. System should allow users to see all the available books in the Library.
    2. It will allow members to borrow books or return books with ease sitting on their desk or table.
    3. System should enable them to extend the borrowing date of the book if there is no other booking in line.
    4. It will help in doing day-to-day book transactions.
    5. The Librarian would know about all the transactions and he can add books to the system which are new in the library.
    6. He can also change the availability of books if any book is taken off the shelf.
    7. This system would work only on the LAN network of the Institute.
    8. This reduces the risk on the system, and acts as a secure point of the system.
    9. Any non-member can access the system to browse or search for the books online.
    10. Authentication of user credentials should be done for members of the Institute.

### Non - Functional Requirements:
    1. No confidential Information should be stored (e.g. passwords) in the form of plain text.
    2. System should go on downtime during the specific hours after sending an alert to users through mail.
    3. Users should authenticate themselves by their Institute provided mail and password set by them.
    4. The process of borrowing or return request should be done under 15 secs.
    5. Site should load in 5 secs if there is large traffic.
    6. Website should be portable such that it works on every OS system.
    7. As the institute is expanding so it should be able to handle large crowds at a time on the website.
    8. Recent HTML 5 should be used for making the website.

** Q2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Ans: **

**Scope:** We are creating an android application for people who have hearing disabilities. In this we will be using Artificial Intelligence to recognize the key sounds like vehicle horns, baby crying, machine working etc. This sound will be detected and an immediate alert will be given to the user about them which will be very helpful for them. There are many people who are suffering from this, Approximately 5% of the world population suffers from hearing disabilities.

**Features:**
    1. It uses Artificial Intelligence to recognize key sounds.
    2. It is a mobile application i.e. it can be used on any OS type.
    3. Shows alerts to users after detecting sounds.
    4. Continual Logging is critical for the user.
    5. App consume less power and have low latency for extended use.
    6. Predictions made by the app should be accurate.
    7. In Critical situations it should take response from the user, if there is no response it should give alerts to family and friends whose details are entered.

**Non-Functional Aspects:**
    1. It is an Android application with low latency for real time use.
    2. Users should be logged in continuously so that they do not get troubled in between the critical situations.
    3. It should detect sounds within 2-3 seconds.
    4. After the detection of no response in critical situations it should send a message to family and friends whose information is given.
    5. No confidential information should be stored in Plain text.
    6. Location of the user should be traced by the app in case of emergency situations.
    7. App should suggest less traffic paths to users.
